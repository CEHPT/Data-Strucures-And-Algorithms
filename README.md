How to play FLAMES Game.

    Write down the names of the two people vertically on a paper.

    Cross out common letters that appear in both names.

    Count the remaining letters (unique letters that are not crossed out).

    Use the word "FLAMES" to determine the relationship:
        F: Friends
        L: Lovers
        A: Affectionate (Admirers)
        M: Marriage (or a potential future together)
        E: Enemies (Not a good match)
        S: Siblings (like brother and sister)

    Count the total number of remaining letters and eliminate letters from "FLAMES" based on that count.

    The letter left at the end reveals the nature of their relationship.

Remember, it's just a fun game and not based on anything serious! Enjoy!
